Introduction
------------
This repository was created to hold the source code for Team 195's VEX Program for the 2012-2013 season. Team 195 employs the VEX Robotics Competition to teach the basics of robotics to new incoming students. Returning students mentor the incoming students at all aspects of the game and robot.

GAME: VEX Sack Attack
---------------------
###Game Details
VEX Sack Attack is played on a 12’x12’ square field configured as seen above. Two alliances – one “red” and one “blue” – composed of two teams each, compete in matches consisting of a fifteen second autonomous period followed by one minute and forty-five seconds of driver- controlled play.

The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by Scoring Sacks and Bonus Sacks in your colored Floor Goals, Troughs and High Goal, and by having the most Robots of your color Parked at the end of the Match.

There are a total of ninety-eight (98) Sacks and four (4) Bonus Sacks available as Scoring Objects in the game. Most Scoring Objects begin in designated locations on the field, while some are available to be loaded prior or during the Match. Each Robot (smaller than 18”x18”x18” to start) begins a match on one of their Alliance Starting Tiles. There are ten (10) scoring areas, five (5) of each color, of varying heights which teams can Score Sacks or Bonus Sacks in. Alliances earn a bonus for having the most Robots of their own color touching their Alliance Starting Tiles at the end of the Match. A bonus is awarded to the Alliance that has the most total points at the end of the Autonomous Period.

About Team 195
--------------
The Cyber Knights, also known as FIRST Team 195, is a robotics team from Southington High School in Southington, CT. The team has actively participated in regional and championship competitions since their first season in 1998.

FIRST Robotics Team 195's mission is to bring the celebration of science and technology to the forefront of our community. FIRST brings tremendous value to students from an experiential learning, college readiness and social perspective. This program provides a unique "varsity sport of the mind" designed to help high-school-aged young people discover how interesting and rewarding the life of engineers and scientists can be.

The FIRST Robotics Competition challenges teams of young people and their mentors to solve a common problem in a six-week time frame using a standard “kit of parts” and a common set of rules. Teams design, build, and program robots and enter them in a series of competitions designed by Dean Kamen, Dr. Woodie Flowers, and a committee of engineers and other professionals.

Our team brings a unique experience and different way of involving students. Rather than just playing with robots in an after school club, these students will be working in a true engineering and business environment alongside professionals. Our team is one of nearly 2000 FIRST robotics teams around the world. Our program is open to all students. Due to budgets being very slim, we rely exclusively on company and community sponsors to keep our program running.
