About Team 195
--------------
The Cyber Knights, also known as FIRST Team 195, is a robotics team from Southington High School in Southington, CT. The team has actively participated in regional and championship competitions since their first season in 1998.

FIRST Robotics Team 195's mission is to bring the celebration of science and technology to the forefront of our community. FIRST brings tremendous value to students from an experiential learning, college readiness and social perspective. This program provides a unique "varsity sport of the mind" designed to help high-school-aged young people discover how interesting and rewarding the life of engineers and scientists can be.

The FIRST Robotics Competition challenges teams of young people and their mentors to solve a common problem in a six-week time frame using a standard “kit of parts” and a common set of rules. Teams design, build, and program robots and enter them in a series of competitions designed by Dean Kamen, Dr. Woodie Flowers, and a committee of engineers and other professionals.

Our team brings a unique experience and different way of involving students. Rather than just playing with robots in an after school club, these students will be working in a true engineering and business environment alongside professionals. Our team is one of nearly 2000 FIRST robotics teams around the world. Our program is open to all students. Due to budgets being very slim, we rely exclusively on company and community sponsors to keep our program running.
